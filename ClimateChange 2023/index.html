		<h1>Climate Change</h1>
        <p>“Climate change is real. It is happening right now, it is the most urgent threat facing our entire 
            species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.” - Leonardo DiCaprio</p>

    <h2 class="facts">The Facts</h2>
    <div id="risingtemp">
        <h3>Increasing Temperatures</h3>
        <p>The Earth's temperature has increased by 1.1℃ since 1880 (NASA Earth Observatory). Although 
            this does not seem like a big deal, it is. Firstly a majority of this increase has been since 
            1975. Since 1975 the Earth has increased by an average of 0.2℃ every decade (NASA Earth Observatory).</p>
        <img src="resources/GlobalTempGraphLN-articleLarge.webp">
        <p>Figure 1: Graph of Increasing Temperature Since 1880 (The Learning Network)</p>
        <h4>Why is it a Concern?</h4>
        <p>
            There are several reasons why this minimal increase is cause for concern. Firstly there is a significant 
            effect on crops and agriculture across Africa and Asia. The increased temperature causes droughts and 
            unordinary rainfall patterns. In 2020 alone, Africa experienced a fifty percent decline in agriculture 
            production (United Nations). Approximately two-hundred million people will be affected in Africa and another
            one-hundred-fifty million in Asia (United Nations). Another terrible effect this increased temperature will 
            have is the spread of disease. With increased temperatures comes a more substantial number of mosquitos. 
            Mosquitos are excellent at spreading disease. Some countries affected by this are the United States and the United Kingdom. 
            The United States saw an increasing number of malaria cases in the early 2000s, and the United Kingdom saw a rising number of 
            legionnaires' diseases (United Nations). With global temperatures rising comes an increased number of insect-born conditions.</p>
        <h4>How is it being caused?</h4>
        <p>The primary cause of this rising temperature is increased carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere (Fecht).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="risingsea">
        <h3>Rising Sea Levels</h3>
        <p>The other major cause for concern is Earth's rising sea levels. Sea levels have risen about ninety-seven millimeters since 1997 (Change). 
        Again this does not seem like a substantial number, but it is.</p>

        <h4>Why is it a Concern?</h4>
        <p>The effects if this continues can be detrimental. For example, storms and floods will increase enormously, especially near coastlines (Sea Level Rise). 
           Thousands of animals could go extinct and interrupt ecosystems humans rely on for supplies and food. Also, thousands of people will have to relocate as
           many major cities lie on coastlines (Sea Level Rise). States like Florida and New York are already experiencing these effects (Sea Level Rise). </p>
